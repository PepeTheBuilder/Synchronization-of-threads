University Project: Queues Management Application using Threads and Synchronization Mechanisms

This repository showcases a university project that I worked on for a period of time. It served as an opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience with various concepts in Java, including:

-Processes                                                                                            
-Threads                                                                                          
-Synchronization mechanisms such as ArrayBlockingQueues and other thread-safe data structures, atomic operations, volatile variables, etc.

Project Description

The project titled "Queues Management Application using Threads and Synchronization Mechanisms" involves the development of an application that simulates a queue system. Clients arrive, wait in line, and are served by available servers within the system. The application utilizes threads to manage the queues and synchronization mechanisms to ensure the correct behavior of the system.

The primary objective is to optimize server utilization and minimize client waiting time.
